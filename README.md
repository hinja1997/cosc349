# cosc349 Assignment 2
Jasmine Hindson - 8148181

This repository contains everything that I am submitting for Assignment 2.

My project is an application that converts the current NZ date into one of the following languages - Italian, Spanish, French, and Portugese. The application uses 2 Virtual Machines which are web servers being hosted by AWS as instances and I am also using a AWS database - RDS to assist the 2 web servers.

(Also you will notice that the commits for assignment 2 have changed to a user called Jasmine Hindson, it's still me, I accidentally started assignment 2 based off my other account, apologies).
