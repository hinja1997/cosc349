This application is a language converter that converts the current NZ date into one of the following langauages - Italian, Spanish, French and Portuegese. The application uses 3VMs, two being web servers and one being a database server.

To run the application, download the zip file. Navigate to the folder within terminal and type 'vagrant up'. This starts up the 3VMs. After the 3VMs have started up, open a web browser and navigate to 127.0.0.1:8080 (localhost:8080).
